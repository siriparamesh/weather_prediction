<h1>Weather Prediction With Python And Machine Learning</h1>
<h3> The project is about predicting a day's  temperature using historical data. <br> The steps include: downloading a dataset of local weather. we can customize this to our own location. Then, we'll clean the data and get it ready for machine learning. <br> We'll build a model to make historical predictions. Then, we'll add more predictors to improve the model. <br></h3>
